**PROJECT:**

Statistical Analysis on Factors influencing Life Expectancy in Developed and Developing countries from year 2000 to 2015 using Correlation & Linear Regression.

**OBJECTIVES:**

	Analysis on factors influencing Life Expectancy in Developed and Developing countries from a period of 2000 to 2015 for 193 countries.
	Determine the predicting factors which are contributing to lower value of Life Expectancy.
	This will help a country in suggesting which area should be given importance in order to efficiently improve the life expectancy of its population.

**Analysis:**

Correlation Observation:
r= Correlation Coefficient
Below 7 independent variables are having strong linear relationship with Life Expectancy, 
Life Expectancy & HIV – (r=0.6)
Life Expectancy & Income Composition Of Resource – (r= 0.72)
Life Expectancy & Literacy rate – (r=0.73)
Life Expectancy & Adult Mortality – (r=0.7)
Life Expectancy & BMI – (r=0.54)
Life Expectancy & thinness5To9years– (r=0.5)
Life Expectancy & thinness1To19years-(r=0.5)

**Linear Regression Model Observation:**

	80% variance in Life Expectancy is explained by variation in the 7 variables (Income Composition Of Resources, HIV, Literacy Rate, Adult Mortality, BMI, thinness 5To9 years   &  thinness 1To19 years) and the rest 20% are unexplained variance.
	p<0.05 for the 5 variables Income Composition Of Resources, HIV, Schooling, Adult Mortality &   BMI means the 5 variables have a significant linear relation with the dependent variable Life Expectancy.

**Residual Analysis:**

	Some of the residual plots shows equally spread residuals around a horizontal line with random pattern which indicate that there is no non-linear relationship in the regression model.
